# ChatGPT-Context-Counter
Simple extention to count the context used so far in the conversation with ChatGPT.

------
What is Context in the light of ChatGPT:
"The context of the conversation is provided to me as a sequence of input tokens, where each token represents a word or subword in the input text. In the context of a conversation, the context is the sequence of messages previously exchanged between the user and the AI."

That is important to follow as once the context size is reached the chat will "forget" what you write with him previously - it will drop out the oldest messages.

This app will give you a nice indicator of how much Context is already in your conversation so to know when you going to start loosing old context.
